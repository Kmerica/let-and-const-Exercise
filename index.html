        <h2>***Quiz***</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>What is the difference between <b>var</b> and <b>let</b>?</li>
                    <p>A variable declared using let is block-scoped and only visible within the block in which it was declared. It may be reassigned but not redeclared.   While a variable declared using var may be reassigned or redeclared.</p>               
                <li>What is the difference between <b>var</b> and <b>const</b>?</li>
                    <p>Var may be reassigned or redeclared, but when using const a variable may not be redeclared or reassigned.  A variable declared using the keyword const is also block-scoped.</p>
                <li>What is the difference between <b>let</b> and <b>const</b>?</li>
                    <p>When a variable is declared with const it may not be reassigned or redeclared.  When a variable is declared with let it may be reassigned.</p>
                <li>What is hoisting?</li>
                    <p>When a variable is moved to the top of its scope before code execution. A variable declared using var can be accessed before it is defined in the codebase.</p>
